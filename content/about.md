I’m a software engineer specializing in distributed systems, P2P networks, and high-load applications.
Over the past decade, I’ve worked with global companies like Huawei and
[contributed to](https://github.com/g4s8) open-source projects.
My expertise lies in building scalable, low-latency systems that handle massive amounts of data efficiently.
I also have a deep passion for performance optimization.

When I’m not writing code, I actively contribute to the open-source community,
sharing my knowledge through [blogs](/posts) and conference [talks](/talks).
