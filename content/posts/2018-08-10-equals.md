title: Object equality (Java)
---

Each [object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object))
in java has two methods to check object equality:
it is `Object.equals(Object other)` and `Object.hashCode()`.
Often developers override these methods so they can store
instances of `Object` subclasses in hash-based collections
e.g. `HashMap`, `HashSet` etc.
I don't like this design where each object can be
compared for equality with any other object, but in this post
I'll not criticize it, rather I'll try to demonstrate how to
implement it correctly for object oriented code.

## Protocol

First of all we need to understand the protocol of these methods,
it's not defined in method signature, but described in javadocs:

> The equals method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references:<br/>
> It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(x)` should return `true`.<br/>
> It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, `x.equals(y)` should return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true`.<br/>
> It is transitive: for any non-null reference values `x`, `y` and `z`, if `x.equals(y)` returns true and `y.equals(z)` returns `true`, then `x.equals(z)` should return `true`.<br/>
> It is consistent: for any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` consistently return `true` or consistently return `false`, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified.
For any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(null)` should return `false`.<br/>
> The `equals` method for class `Object` implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects; that is, for any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, this method returns `true` if and only if `x` and `y` refer to the same object (`x == y` has the value `true`).<br/>
> Note that it is generally necessary to override the `hashCode` method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the `hashCode` method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

It's important to remember that all these requirements are handshake deals, java compiler will not be able to
check that developers obey these arrangements.


## Implementing

It's very easy to implement `equals()` or `hashCode()` for
[DTOs](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/06/data-transfer-object.html)
which are very popular in java world,
even the most popular IDE
[can generate](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generate-equals-and-hashcode-wizard.html)
these methods automatically. Also it's not a problem to write it for `final` classes
which don't implement domain types.

But if you're making object-oriented java module, then, most probably, you have interfaces for
your domain objects and many implementations or decorators for them. For instance you may have `User`
object:
```java
interface User {
  /**
   * User id.
   */
  String uid();
  
  /**
   * User name.
   */
  String name();
}
```
and implementations:
 - `User user = new SqlUser(database, id)` - to find user in a database by id
 - `User user = new RqUser(users, request)` - to get current user from HTTP request
 - `User user = users.user(id)` - user by id from `Users` object

In all these cases we may have different class implementations of same object
and we are not able to use `User` as a key in hash-based collection if we implement
`equals`/`hashCode` as JDK tutorials suggested, because each class will check
that another object has same class type as self: it's required to be *symmetric*,
because if we don't do type checking we can get `true` result for `x.equals(y)`, but not
for `y.equals(x)` if `x` class implements equality check based on interface, but
`y` class don't do that (or event it uses `Object.equals` implementation).

So how to solve it? If we don't want to ignore built-in collections (like `HashMap` or `HashSet`),
but wants to decorate our objects and use different implementations of one interface we need
to invent another approach for writing `equals` methods to satisfy JDK requirements, but do not brake
OO code.

## Decorators

I've found a solution which can help here: we can create the decorator for
our domain object which will implement `equals` based on interface methods,
not fields of the object. To begin we need to find *identity* method which will return always same
value for one object instance and will be unique for different objects, this is required by
`equals` rules to be *consistent*.
For `User` object it will be `uid()` (user id) method,
which is unique for different users and always the same for one user instance.
We need to use this method in actual `equals` and `hashCode` implementations:
```java
final class EqUser implements User {
    private final User origin;

    EqUser(final User origin) {
        this.origin = origin;
    }

    @Override
    public String uid() {
        return this.origin.uid();
    }
    @Override
    public String name() {
        return this.origin.name();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(final Object obj) {
        final boolean same;
        if (obj instanceof EqUser) {
            final User other = (User) obj;
            same = Objects.equals(this.uid(), other.uid());
        } else {
            same = false;
        }
        return same;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(this.origin.uid());
    }
}
```
as `Object.equals` protocol is based on "verbal arrangements", our implementation
also assumes that `User.uid` implements correctly `equals` and `hashCode`, it's `String`
in this case, so we can be sure that it's true.
Let's check java equality requirements:
 - this implementation is "reflexive": `x.equals(x) == true` because `x.uid().equals(x.uid()) == true`
 - it is "symmetric": if `x.equals(y)` is `true` then `y.equals(x)` is `true` also, because
  `EqUser` accepts only `EqUser` implementations as other object,
  so it can be converted to if `x.uid().equals(y.uid())` is `true` then `y.uid().equals(x.uid())`
  is `true` also
 - it is "transitive": if `x.equals(y) && y.equals(z)` then `x.equals(z)`, because when
  `x.equals(y) && y.equals(z)` so `x.uid().equals(y.uid()) && y.uid().equals(z.uid())` and
  `x.uid().equals(z.uid())` what means that `x.equals(z)`
 - it is "consistent": we assume that `x.uid()` is consistent


## Example

And an example now. For instance we need to store user permissions as strings
and grant them to some user but we can't be assure what `User` implementation
we might be handling with:
```java
final class Permissions {
  final Map<User, Set<String>> map = new HashSet<>();

  /**
   * Check user has permission.
   */
  public boolean has(final User user,
    final String permission) {
    final EqUser key = new EqUser(user);
    return map.contains(key) &&
      map.get(key).contains(permission);
  }

  /**
   * Grant permission to the user.
   */
  public void grant(final User user,
    final String permission) {
    final EqUser key = new EqUser(user);
    final Set<String> set;
    if (!map.contains(key)) {
      set = new HashSet<>();
      map.put(key, set);
    } else {
      set = map.get(key);
    }
    set.add(permission);
 } 
}
```
so we can grant user permission with one type:
```java
permissions.grant(
  new RqUser(users, request), "read"
); // grant 'read' permission to current user
```
and then check it with any other implementation:
```java
SqlUsers users;
if (permissions.has(users.user(id), "read")) {
  return data.readAllBytes();
}
```
