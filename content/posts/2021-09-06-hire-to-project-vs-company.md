I noticed that quite often headhunters are hiring into a company
without saying what will be the project. Usually, it happens for
headhunters from big companies. This situation is confusing me because
I don't really want just to be employee of some company, I want to know
what product exactly I'll make there. Maybe for beginner programmer it's
a good choice to join a big organization and learn how processes are
organized but I don't really understand why a senior developer
can accept such an offer. I thought that maybe it's only my concern about
the project for future work so I talked with a few senior engineers,
and they not only share my view but also tell me some interesting stories about
it.
